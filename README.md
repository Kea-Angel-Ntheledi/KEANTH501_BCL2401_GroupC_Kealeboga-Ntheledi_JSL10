# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

## Project overview:
The "Escape Vanilla JS Challenge" is an interactive web-based project that focuses on debugging skills, problem-solving, and abstract thinking. The project takes users through three themed "rooms," each with a unique JavaScript-based challenge. The ultimate goal is to help users master advanced concepts in Vanilla JavaScript, preparing them for learning React and other frameworks.

## Elements included:
JavaScript Concepts: The project covers a wide range of topics, including iterators and generators, built-in objects, working with maps and sets, regular expressions, manipulating dates and times, JSON, the console API, and transitioning from Vanilla JavaScript to React.
Interactive Challenges: Users navigate through a series of challenges designed to test their debugging skills and problem-solving abilities. Each challenge requires the user to fix code snippets or correct logical errors to proceed to the next room.
Thematic Structure: The project is structured like an escape room, where each "room" presents a unique theme and challenge. This structure adds an element of fun and engagement to the learning experience.

## Areas of mastery:
Debugging skills, 
Advanced JavaScript concepts,
Problem solving

## Challenges:
Understanding Advanced Concepts: Topics like iterators, generators, and asynchronous programming can be challenging to grasp without prior experience.
Understanding Advanced Concepts: Topics like iterators, generators, and asynchronous programming can be challenging to grasp without prior experience.

## Areas of improvement:
Advanced guidance,
Expanded explainations, exampkes and tutorials.

## Overall learning experience:
The "Escape Vanilla JS Challenge" offers a fun and interactive way to learn and improve JavaScript skills. The escape room structure keeps users engaged, while the variety of challenges ensures a comprehensive learning experience. Despite some challenges with complexity and advanced concepts, the project provides a solid foundation for those looking to transition from Vanilla JavaScript to React and other advanced frameworks. With additional guidance and expanded tutorials, the learning experience could be further enhanced, making it suitable for a broader range of users.

## What You Need to Do:

1. Clone the provided Starter Code Repository to your local development environment (e.g., VSCode): https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_10_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL10
2. Open the cloned project in your code editor.
3. Code your solution for each of the challenges as per the provided instructions.
4. Commit your changes to your local Git repository with meaningful commit messages.
5. Push your local Git repository to your GitHub account.
6. Verify that the changes have been successfully pushed to your GitHub repository.

#### Debugging Tasks

1. **Correct the ID used in the event listener for Room 1.**
2. **Use the correct element ID when displaying results for Room 1.**
3. **Add the missing 'async' keyword to the JS concepts set.**
4. **Correct the function call to find the intersection of `jsConcepts` and `reactConcepts` for Room 2.**
5. **Ensure asynchronous operations are handled correctly in Room 3, particularly by adding `await` before the promise in `navigateLabyrinth`.**
6. **Adjust the `findMostRecentBook` function to correctly compare dates and find the most recent book.**
7. **Fix the `findIntersection` function to correctly determine the intersection of two sets.**
8. **Add the `await` keyword before `new Promise` in `navigateLabyrinth` to ensure the simulation of asynchronous operations works as intended.**

## What You Need to Include:

1. Ensure that your code includes the necessary modifications to meet the challenge requirements.
2. Your GitHub repository should contain the updated code files.

## How We'll Assess Your Work:

1. We will review your GitHub repository to ensure that it contains the updated code files.
2. We will assess the modifications made to the code to verify that they effectively meet the challenge requirements.
3. We will consider the commit history and meaningful commit messages to evaluate your coding process.
